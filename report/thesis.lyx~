Introduction

\begin_layout Section
Problem Statement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Robotic systems have been getting more mobile and prevalent in recent years.
 And with that comes new possibilities and uses.
 One project trying to take advantage of this is the TRADR project, Long-Term
 Human-Robot Teaming for Robot-Assisted Disaster Response
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kruijff2015tradr"

\end_inset

.
 It aims to create teams of robots and humans that work together to provide
 incidence response.
 Research into robot team communication is what prompted this research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Autonomous robots in in disaster areas, including the industrial areas given
 by the TRADR use cases, need to be able to cooperate amongst themselves
 and with humans
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kruijff2015tradr"

\end_inset

.
 However because of the mobile nature of such robots this raises new questions
 about what happens when communication becomes unreliable.
 Wireless signals may not reach everywhere
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "micheli2015measurement,cisco"

\end_inset

 and wired communication isn't generally feasible when staying mobile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This requires us to look closer at the effects of having communication fail.
 While it is easy to presume that this will have undersired effects it is
 hard to predict what effects that will be.
 Only once these effects, if they exist, have been measured we can look
 at potential mitigation strategies.
 And of course determine their effectiveness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Research Questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To this end we will provide answers to the following questions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What are the effects of communication failure of multi-agent team effectiveness?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If there are negative effects to the effectiveness, how can we mitigate
 these effects?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we define a single instance communication failure as the recipient
 not having a message that the sender meant for it to have.
 Irregardless of where in the transmission process the failure occured,
 e.g.
 while sending or receiving.
 And effectiveness is both the rate of task completion, and the time taken
 to complete the task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Research approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To gather the data we will create simulations of agent teams enduring communicat
ion failure.
 How this is set up exactly is descriped in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Experiment-Design"

\end_inset

.
 However this will be done in two parts.
 The first part will be an exploratory one where pre-existing agent teams
 for BW4T will be used.
 These agents have been made for other purposes and will help identify potential
 stumbling blocks.
 The second part is a set of specifically designed agents to more closely
 evaluate the effects of different kinds of communication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences in effectiveness from the second part will be used to see
 if the effects differ depending on how the communication fails and how
 well different agent strategies deal with the failure.
 This will all be simulated as it allows for stricter control of the experimenta
l dimensions in addition to making it easier to perform a large amount experimen
t runs for each scenario.
 Afterwards the results of the simulations can be compared to baselines
 where no communication failure is happening to answer the first research
 question.
 Then based on the data we can see where the effects are strongest, and
 if there are agents that work well in different situations.
 From these we can identify potential mitigation strategies.
 Which can be simulated in the same scenarios as before to compare their
 effectiveness and answer the second question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gathered data will be analysed using Chi square analysis to determine
 if the results are significantly different from the reference data.
 This will give us two analyses using both the one agent team baseline and
 the no communication team.
 This comparison we will only look at the rate of task completion within
 the timeout period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If this shows there are indeed significant differences we can look for the
 effect the different communication failure scenarios on task completion
 time.
 As a first step regression analysis can see if there is an effect using
 both the type of team, size of the team, and the failure scenarios as independe
nt variables.
 Pending determination on if they have a signicant effect on the task completion
 rate.
 As an additional analysis to if there is a difference in how the different
 team types are affected each team type will have a separate regression
 analysis using the team size and failure scenarios.
 The same analysis will be done using the task completion time as the dependent
 variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Experiment Design
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sec:Experiment-Design"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the effects of communication failure, if any, on multi-agent
 systems we will use a well explored domain for multi-agents systems.
 The Blocks World for Teams GOAL environment as this is well defined and
 thoroughly explored system for doing research on multi-agent systems.(references
) The basic concept is that an agent, or multiple agents, have to bring
 blocks to a certain place, the dropzone in a specific order.
 The blocks are distinguished by color only so any block that is the right
 color will suffice.
 These blocks are found in rooms that have one entrance from the hallway
 spaces.
 While that is the basic scenario it has built in several option for adjusting
 various environment variables such as the room placement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Experiment Dimensions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However it is not just the room placement that can be varied.
 We have categorised the variables involved in the above mentioned experimental
 setup.
 Each categorgy has multiple dimensions as shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:experiment dimensions"

\end_inset

 and will be discussed in more detail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The environment is mainly the way the experiment world is constructed, how
 many hallways and where, and the placement of the rooms, but also includes
 the block sequence and agent collisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second is the agents and their teams themselves.
 The team size can be adjusted, limited by the amount of computing power
 available.
 Though world limitations, such as only one agent can enter a room at a
 time, might limit the effectiveness of a team larger than the amount of
 rooms available or than there are blocks in the sequence.
 Once you have a team you can consider team composition.
 Are all agents the same or do they have different programs.
 Finally, what kind of programs do the agents run with.
 Minimal programs, full coordination, what kind of data do they share, which
 resolution strategies are used, there is an almost infinite amount of possibili
ties here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally there is the communication and how it can fail.
 Does the sending or receiving fail, and if it does fail is it a fixed percentag
e of messages that fails? Of does the failure rate increase over time? is
 the message more likely to fail if the receipient is further away? Those
 are several ways the failure of messages can be done.
 Finally there is something to consider regarding communicating itself.
 Do the global percepts provided by the environment always arrive? Since
 they include things like when a block is delivered at the dropzone.
 This could effectively be a side-channel for certain kinds of messages
 that always succeeeds.
 So the agents can not use it and have to distribute such information through
 the normal channels.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Experiment reduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above mentioned experiment dimensions have too many options to realistically
 test everything.
 However we have evaluated all of them to see where the dimensions can be
 reduced so it only requires a manageable amount of simulations.
 The dimensions are discussed grouped by category as given by table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:experiment dimensions"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Environment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The size and shape of the world the agents move around in for example can
 be kept consistent and seen as outside of the scope for these experiments.
 As that would be looking at the effects of the environment on communication
 failure.
 As such only one map design will be used across the experiments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However switching the sequence between random and only one colour is still
 a possibility left to us.
 However all the same colour, would eliminate the need to communicate about
 where in the sequence the team is.
 Which, for some types of agents, is the only thing communicated.
 As such using random, where it can not be assumed the communication isn't
 needed, is the preferred case.
 While the simplicity that can be assumed with just one colour might help
 in building the agents the increased communication if that isn't the case
 is preferred.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Agents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Limiting the number of sizes used for the agent teams would drastically
 reduce the experiment space as well.
 And not all sizes need to be tested to get a sense of the effects, if there
 is one, communication failures might have.
 The case of having only one agent, would not need a lot of experimentation
 as there is nothing to communicate with, however it will still be useful
 to do once as a baseline reference.
 Next, using a size sample of three agents will be useful to test, as this
 is the minimum amount of agents needed to have a team where it is possible
 to communicate with more than one agent at the same time.
 Which is needed for some communication failure modes to matter.
 Next would be five agents, as this is a larger group, but is also just
 a bit more than half the amount of rooms available in the default map setup
 and one less than the amount of blocks needed in the sequence.
 This means the way tasks get divided amongst agents becomes important.
 As not every agent can continue exploring after just one set of rooms.
 As well as increasing the amount of agents involved in communicating.
 The next step should not go too far, as experience with the environment
 has shown that 10 agents start to tax the hardware and might degrade the
 simulation.
 But looking at a group with a size close to the amount of rooms available
 will be interesting to see how that influences the behaviour.
 As such going one agent fewer than the amount of rooms in the standard
 setup, eight, has been chosen as the last group size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All these agent teams still need a team composition.
 While they could have different programs, this might introduce higher order
 effects that would make analysis more complicated, as well as requiring
 a lot more simulations.
 While these effects might be interesting, determining the effects, if any,
 in the simple case takes priority.
 So in the interest of limiting the time spent with simulations, and analyzing
 homogenous agent teams will be used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But that still leaves options for varying the teams themselves, though they
 will all have similar components as shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Agent-types"

\end_inset

.
 These agent programs are chosen from all possibilities because they are
 simple, build upon each other, and let us explore what happens with differing
 degrees of communication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To properly compare the teams baselines are needed.
 The simplest baseline is a single agent exploring rooms and delivering
 blocks as soon as it finds the currently needed block.
 This will let us evaluate how teams perform compared to a single agent,
 even with the communication failure.
 This is then used to make the team baseline, which only communicates which
 blocks have been delivered.
 A third team will also communicate which blocks can be found in rooms they
 explore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From here the agent types branch out into two types that differ in their
 coordination strategies.
 The agents will coordinate their actions to see who is best suited to do
 what task at any given moment.
 But the way they coordinate differs, one team asks first if they can do
 something, before conflict resolution happens if needed.
 The other team starts doing a task, and then verifies that nobody else
 is doing it, before going to conflict resolution.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Communication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the experiment it is pretty important to figure out what kind of communicati
on failure is going to be tested.
 The simplest of which is to test the difference between sending failure
 and receiving failure.
 As sending failure means that if a message fails no agent gets it but receiving
 failure means that some part of the team may receive it.
 So both options will be tested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This can be done with various ways of determining the likelihood that a
 message will fail.
 For reference each team will also do simulations without communication
 failure, meaning 
\begin_inset Formula $0\%$
\end_inset

.
 To get insight into how different amounts of failure affect performance
 using set percetages is very useful.
 This will be a spread from 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 to a
\begin_inset Formula $100\%$
\end_inset

.
 To limit the amount of runs needed 
\begin_inset Formula $25\%$
\end_inset

 increments will be used initially.
 However all communication and no communication could have different results
 from only a little or a lot of communication 
\begin_inset Formula $5\%$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $95\%$
\end_inset

 will be tested as well.
 Making the complete range of tested percentages 
\begin_inset Formula $0,5,25,50,75,95,$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $100\%$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, how are global percepts treated.
 These function similar to a second, infallible communication channel.
 As this is all about testing the effects of communication failure these
 will be ignored.
 Instead for the current state of the sequence has to be communicated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For half of the tests the agents can still see the state of the sequence
 when they enter the dropzone.
 This allows for correcting the sequence state as the exploratory data has
 shown that without the correction programs break down fast otherwise.
 Even a 
\begin_inset Formula $5\%$
\end_inset

 failure can in many cases cut the amount of successful runs in half.
 An overview of these results can be found in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:com-effects-succes-fail"

\end_inset

 gives us an overview of what was expected to happen in the various scenarios.
 While even the guaranteed successful scenarios might not finish within
 the timeframe given for the experiments they should more often do so than
 in scenarios where success might not always be possible.
 In these cases different strategies can be compared for how much they slow
 down compared to the reference and what the major causes for slowdown are.

The types of communication that can cause failure do this for different
 reasons.
 The first does this by incorrect information, the place in the sequence,
 leading to wasting resources and making the task impossible.
 The second one does it by having the agent logic deadlock and cause them
 to not do anything.
 It should be noted that in the second case it is theoretically possible
 to still finish as opposed to the first situation.
 {{Does this mean anything? Like make it more important to fix as it is
 only limited by programming?
